# Turn-based Combat
A clone of the Turn-based Combat game in [Brackeys tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1pz_ohupPs)

However this game uses the RSToolkit BehaviourTree system for the enemy AI and also
the RSToolkit FSM along with other RSToolkit components.

A notable difference is that the Enemy decides wether to attack or heal rather than
constantly attack.
